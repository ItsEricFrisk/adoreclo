# Adoréclo

This project is a front-end development practice centered on enhancing my skills in web design and visual aesthetics. The primary goal is to create a visually appealing design, tailored to evoke the style and identity of a new clothing brand.

Inspired by images and videos provided from Adore Clothing, I used these materials as a reference to shape my own interpretation of a fresh, modern clothing line's digital presence. While the design does not mimic any specific e-commerce structure—certain foundational elements like product links in the header are intentionally not included—this project focuses purely on creating an engaging, brand-inspired aesthetic.
